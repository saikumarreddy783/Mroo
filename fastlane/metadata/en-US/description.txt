The NEW app from HabitRPG! Rewritten from the ground up for a smoother experience and more features.

Treat your life like a game to stay motivated and organized! Habitica makes it simple to have fun while accomplishing goals.

Input your Habits, your Daily goals, and your To-Do list, and then create a custom avatar. Check off tasks to level up your avatar and unlock features such as armor, pets, skills, and even quests! Fight monsters with friends to keep each other accountable, and use your gold on in-game rewards, like equipment, or custom rewards, like watching an episode of your favorite TV show. Flexible, social, and fun, Habitica is the perfect way to motivate yourself to accomplish anything.

Habitica can be fully enjoyed for free, but if you would like to help support us, we also offer optional in-app purchases and subscriptions. If you choose to purchase a subscription, payment will be charged to your iTunes account only when you confirm your purchase. The longer the length of your subscription, the more gems you can purchase for gold!

There are four types of optional Habitica subscriptions: $4.99 every month; $14.99 every three months; $29.99 every six months; and $47.99 every year, which is a 28% discount! (Prices may vary by location.) Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.  Auto-renewal may be turned off in your Account Settings in iTunes after purchase. You can also manage your subscriptions in Account Settings after purchase. Thanks for choosing Habitica!
