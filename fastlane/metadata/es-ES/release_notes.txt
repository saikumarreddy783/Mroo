In this update, we've added an exciting new introduction and a fancy new login screen featuring a lovely nighttime Habitica landscape. There's also an improved tutorial to help new Habiticans get started with slaying their tasks! And last but not least, we've made Habitica prettier by updating some of our design elements.

We hope you enjoy the update! Be sure to download it now for a better Habitica experience!
